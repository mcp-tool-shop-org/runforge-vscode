# Changelog

All notable changes to the RunForge VS Code extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.2] - pending

### Architecture
- Consolidated `.ml/outputs/index.json` to a single writer (Python `provenance.py`).
  TS `index-manager.ts` write path removed. Same consolidation pattern as
  iter #2's `spawnRunnerScript` deletion.
- Canonical types now live exclusively in `src/types.ts` (`IndexEntry`, `RunIndex`,
  `MetricsV1`, `FeatureImportance`, `LinearCoefficients`, `RunMetadata`). Observability
  layer no longer defines shadow types.
- Field-name reconciliation: `dataset_fingerprint` → `dataset_fingerprint_sha256`
  (matches Python's existing schema field name).
- `INDEX_SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped `0.2.2.1` → `1.0.0` to mark the canonical 10-field
  consolidation; legacy on-disk shapes migrated transparently on read.
- New: [`docs/CONTRACTS.md`](docs/CONTRACTS.md) codifies the 6 doctrine rules
  surfaced by 5 iterations of architectural debt resolution.
- Subprocess env hygiene consolidated in `pythonSpawnEnv()` helper —
  `PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'` and `PYTHONUNBUFFERED='1'` now set on
  every Python spawn (training, version check, GPU probe, dataset
  inspect, artifact inspect).
- Canonical `InterpretabilityIndex` + supporting summary types in
  `src/types.ts`. Observability layer no longer defines local shadow.
- New `ARTIFACT_FILENAMES` constant in `src/types.ts` — single source
  of truth for artifact filenames (run.json, metrics.v1.json, etc.).
  11 literal-string sites replaced.

### Fixed
- `F-COORD-008` (CRITICAL, iter #3): observability hardcoded `.runforge/` paths;
  replaced with `WORKSPACE_PATHS` constants from `src/types.ts`.
- `F-COORD-010` (CRITICAL, iter #4): index.json write/read shape drift
  (bare-array vs `{runs:[]}`); now `{schema_version, runs:[]}` canonical.
- `F-COORD-011` + `F-FS-001/002/003` + `F-TS-001` (CRITICAL, iter #5a):
  shadow `IndexEntry` and `RunMetadata` in observability with diverging fields
  collapsed onto canonical imports from `src/types.ts`.
- `F-COORD-003` (CRITICAL, iter #2): broken `spawnRunnerScript` directory-form
  invocation; now uses `python -m ml_runner` via `spawnRunner`.
- F-COORD-004 (CRITICAL): Windows non-UTF-8 locales no longer corrupt
  Python subprocess output. PYTHONIOENCODING set natively.
- F-SP-002 (HIGH): success detection now requires `run.json` present
  at run dir after exit code 0 — not just exit-code success.
  Catches mid-write crashes that previously appeared as 'succeeded'.
- F-SP-003 (HIGH): GPU torch probe drops stderr at OS level via
  `stdio: ['ignore','pipe','ignore']`. Import warnings no longer
  fragile-break the JSON parse.
- F-SP-004 (HIGH): all 6 Python spawn sites now use `pythonSpawnEnv()`
  — `PYTHONUNBUFFERED='1'` consistently set.
- F-LD-001 (HIGH): `.ml`/`runs` literal at `src/workspace/run-folder.ts:97`
  replaced with `WORKSPACE_PATHS.RUNS_DIR` constant.

### Tests
- Added full-chain regression: production `appendToIndex` → `safeReadIndex`
  journey, no JSON stub-writes in setup (Rule 5 of `docs/CONTRACTS.md`).
- 18 new regression tests in `test/regression-iter-5b.test.ts`:
  9 for `pythonSpawnEnv` shape, 5 for success detection, 3 for
  GPU stderr isolation. Total test count 247 → 265.

### CI
- Removed redundant `PYTHONIOENCODING: utf-8` env from CI test step
  (now set natively in `pythonSpawnEnv`).
- `npm run verify` lint step is now blocking (was non-blocking shim
  during iter #5a's eslint cleanup phase).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-25

### Note (added 2026-04-25)

Marketplace v1.0.1 shipped with 5 production-CRITICAL bugs (subprocess ImportError, encoding, observability path mismatch, index shape, index entry shape) discovered during the Dogfood Swarm. All five are fixed on `swarm/dogfood` and will ship in v1.0.2. Users on v1.0.1 should upgrade to v1.0.2 (or later) for working `Train` and run-browsing features.

### Added
- 5 version consistency tests (semver, CHANGELOG, engine constraint, publisher)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting policy and data scope
- Threat model section in README (data touched, data NOT touched, permissions)
- Codecov badge in README
- MCP Tool Shop footer in README
- `verify` script — test + compile + VSIX package in one command
- Coverage reporting with @vitest/coverage-v8 and Codecov in CI
- Dependency audit job in CI
- Node 18 + 20 matrix in CI
- VSIX packaging verification in CI
- SHIP_GATE.md and SCORECARD.md for product standards tracking

### Changed
- SafeError now includes `retryable` field (Shipcheck Tier 1 compliance)
- Promoted to v1.0.0 — all Shipcheck hard gates pass

## [0.4.5] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- 82 new tests covering formatters, run-manager helpers, and metadata (187 total).
- Exported `isOomError` and `formatDuration` from run-manager for testability.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-02-27

### Changed
- Patch version bump.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- New command: **Export Latest Run as Markdown** — generates a formatted summary with overview, dataset info, metrics (including v1 detailed metrics and confusion matrix), interpretability artifacts, and file listing. Saved to `run-summary.md` in the run directory.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-19

### Added
